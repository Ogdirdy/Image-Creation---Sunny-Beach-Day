# Image-Creation---Sunny-Beach-Day
**Overview**

This project is a C++ graphics art program created using the PNGWriter class. The program generates a themed digital artwork by combining shapes, colors, gradients, and text. The objective is to creatively explore the PNGWriter graphics library while demonstrating technical proficiency through the use of at least thirty-five (35) PNGWriter member functions.

**Theme**

“Sunny Beach Day”
The generated image represents a bright and relaxing beach scene. The artwork includes a clear sky, a shining sun, ocean waves, a sandy shore, and simple abstract elements such as clouds and beach objects. Warm and cool color contrasts are used to capture the feeling of a sunny day by the sea.
